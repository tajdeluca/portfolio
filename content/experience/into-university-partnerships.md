### Background
My current place of work, and what a place! It was a big jump to go from the travel industry to the education sector but I'm glad I made it.

INTO University Partnerships encourages personal growth and the digital team in particular, of which I am a part of, is particularly adept at this. I feel it naturally sits well with my personal self improvement goals and provides a really fantastic environment to work in!

I should also note that this was a huge jump in stacks from primarily PHP to C# .NET Core. A lot of differences, but a lot of similarities too.

### The projects I worked on
I primarily focus on a single, large, project which is the Partner Portal application. I occasionally touch upon other things, but these are mostly internal.

### What I work with and the skills I develop
INTO University Partnerships really gives me the opportunity to flex my front-end work. Other than that, here's what I'm doing:

- Angular
- C# .NET Core Web APIs
- TypeScript
- Mentoring
- Pair Programming
- Azure
- Azure DevOps

### Crowning achievements
- Optimisations to build pipelines to speed up development.
- Working closely with junior developers to increase their pool of knowledge.
- Working closely with the wider team to ensure the delivery of a great quality product.
- Developing a simple translation pipeline to enable our web apps to be localised in a streamlined manner.
