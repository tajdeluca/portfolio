### Background
My current place of work, and what a place! It was a big jump to go from the travel industry to the education sector but I'm glad I made it.

INTO University Partnerships encourages personal growth and the digital team in particular, of which I am a part of, is particularly adept at this. I feel it naturally sits well with my personal self improvement goals and provides a really fantastic environment to work in!

I should also note that this was a huge jump in stacks from primarily PHP to C# .NET Core. A lot of differences, but a lot of similarities too.

### The projects I worked on
I primarily focus on a single, large, project which is the Partner Portal application. I occasionally touch upon other things, but these are mostly internal.

### What I work with and the skills I develop
INTO University Partnerships really gives me the opportunity to flex my front-end work. Other than that, here's what I'm doing:

- Angular
- C# .NET Core Web APIs
- TypeScript
- Mentoring
- Pair Programming
- Azure
- Azure DevOps

### Crowning achievements
- Aiding in the high pressure, time sensitive, delivery of a high profile product within the organisation, the partner portal
- Mentoring less experienced  developers and coming up with training projects to enable them to grasp various concepts such as continuous integration
- Working with product owners and key stakeholders to translate business requirements into technical designs and requirements
- Leading development planning sessions to ensure that any knowledge gaps and misunderstandings can be cleared up before starting on sprint work
- Streamlining repetitive development processes to prevent breaking changes to occur
  - For example adding basic validation checks to pull requests for things like linting
- Identifying bottlenecks in sprint processes and addressing them by applying technical fixes or working through them with the wider team
- Sharing knowledge by writing Confluence articles, giving presentations and updating the team via Slack (or more recently, Microsoft Teams)
